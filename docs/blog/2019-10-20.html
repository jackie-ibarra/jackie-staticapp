        <h1>Finding the booty</h1>
        

  
    
<p>It was a dark and stormy night. There was nothin to do on the boat. I had to braid my beard, that’s how bored I was. I even started singing to past the time. I was about to start clear the decks and mopping the walls.It was also almost midnight when I heard the noise coming out of the ocean water.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Then noise came out of nowhere and everywhere all at once. It sounded like singing but also like screaming. I came out to the decks and, of course, couldn’t see anything. So, I had to go back inside to look for a lantern. Just my luck, I could’t find anything. I know, I’m a bad pirate.</p>

  

  
    
<p>After like 20 minutes of trying to find a light, the noise kept getting closer and closer and closer and closer and closer until it sounded like it was coming from right outside the captain’s quarters. As a pirate, I couldn’t show fear…but as a man I was terrified! What the heck am I supposed to do? Fight it? No way. My heart was pounding as I reached for the door. Was I going to die? I closed my eyes and turned the knob, ready to accept whatver ye fate may be.</p>

  

  
    
<p>I opened my eyes and…it was a freaking booty bird! I need more sleep.</p>
